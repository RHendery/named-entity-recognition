How much we ought to thank God, during our pilgrimage on earth, for allowing us, as he does, to reap the solid enjoyments which the contemplation of his good creation affords us. Compare these pure delights with the trumpery pleasures of the carnal mind, & we shall be at no loss to comprehend the nature of “that light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world”. How silly & how sinful should we (who have tasted these benefits), become, if ever we were to suffer the gross pleasures of the world, or the diseased fancies of melancholy men to wrest them from us. To all such we have the ready answer which S t Paul teaches us to apply “no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but loveth it & cherisheth it as Christ the church” We then who have found if it good for our flesh to admire the Creator of all things thro’ his wonderous works, should not neglect our calling, our happy callings, of speaking of those works to others– I don’t say this under the idea that you are willfully neglecting my request, but to stir you up by way of remembrance that next to [hole in page] daily prayers, you have a more [hole in page] means of entering [hole in page] the rest, which all true believers enjoy, than by seeking diligently to transfer some portion of that happiness which you profess yourself with the hearts & minds of others.

{"id": 2781, "text": "I think Mr Jenyns' Observations on the Ornithology of Cambridgeshire well worthy of being printed. As you have requested me to make any remarks that may occur to me, I take the liberty of mentioning a few things which have struck me during the hasty perusal which I have been able to give to his observations. Under the head Insectivori the Cinercon[?] shrike is said to have been shot at Melbourne. This is a mistake – it was found recently killed probably by a hawk. Would it not be advisable to state that this bird feeds on birds and mice as well as insects. It swallows small birds and mice entire. The accentor alpinus was not shot in my garden but in the open space immediately under the last window of the Chapel. The Boarula[?] often appears in Octr: or earlier on our lawn and in the field on the other side the river. I have known 3 or four Martins stay about the South side of Clare Hall till the 18th of Novr. I have seen a single swift for many successive days about our chapel during the early part of Septr. I do not know if it be worth recording that a considerable number of a Covey of partridges bred in the neighbourhood of Clay high [?] were perfectly white. A Stone curlew in its first feathers was brought to me alive about two years ago which I was told was bred very near Cambridge. The Crane used to breed in England. Turner page 48. says apud Anglos etiam nidulantur grues in locis palustribus et eorum (vipiones) – young cranes – saepissime vidi. He does not mention the Cambridge fens, but probably alludes to them, As for what he says respecting the siskin he was acquainted with the country about Cambridge. I have known five or six whimbrels offered for sale at Cambridge. A solitary snipe also was brought to market some time since, but was too much mutilated by shot to be fit for stuffing. The Gallinula Baillonii was caught alive at Melbourne [?]. I have been informed by a person who frequents the market that the coot is often sold in the Cambridge market. Anser ferns [?]. A. Segetum [?] A. albifrons A. Bernicla [ ?] As far as my experience extends I cannot agree in the frequent appearance of most of these birds in the Cambridge market. More than ninety in a hundred which are sold there I believe to be Bean Geese. I have not yet been able to purchase the Anser ferus [?]. I have not known the albifrons to have been sold there above two or three times nor have I been able to procure from thence either a Brent Goose or a Barnacle both of which are not uncommon in the London markets at some season. Anas Strepera Gadwall [?) I find by a note in my Montagu that two of these birds were offered for sale in Cambridge market, Feb. 25 1824. Anas Iadorna [?] Sheldrake not uncommon. I procured only the male [?] on April 1st at Cambridge. I do not know where the female was killed.

You say you are Professor, but you do not exactly tell me of what, therefore I beg you, to be so good, as to inform me, \"tout suit\". You give one kind of a hint, that you are Professor of Botany, but I am not quite certain as to that matter.

If I go to France this year, I shall send you  some. The Shyzanthus porrigens (sic), of course you have got, as also the Commelina coelestis. I wish for some seeds of a poppy whose name I do not know, but its appearance, is nearly this - it has a very bright scarlet blossom, with a blank eye, and the leaf is like the horned, or sea poppy, and it bears the seed in the same way.

I find that Juke has not sold all his property in the Isle of Mann nor does he intend it - but what he is to do with the house I cannot make out unless he intends to let it off in flats, like the houses in Scotland.

Besides 500 herrings, & 1 lb of coarse sugar, to sweeten                             the rice to the Children – I find the Rice has made great progress in                             the affections of most of the people – Our plan was to allow such                             families as had 2 or more children under 14 years, to purchase 10lb for                             each child – & those that had 3 or more to purchase (in                             addition either 5lb of flour or 7lb more rice for 1d – the latter                             receiving their quota in 2 deliveries (of which one will take place                             tomorrow) – & I find that more than half of those who preferred to                             take the addition in flour last time now prefer to take all in rice – in                             fact very few stick to the flour.

{"id": 2799, "text": "I have this evening rec. d the Prospectus of your Diagrams which I have read with much interest. I hear from Don & Son that they are very beautiful; and Lyon Playfair who I met in Dublin on the first ins t., told me the same. I do sincerely hope that the sale of them may be extensive, and that they may serve not as decorations for the school-room, but as the means of leading every pupil to a practical knowledge of all that they are intended to teach. The great difficulty I have found is with the teachers. They have to become learners, before they can attempt to teach. Some are indolent—some not disposed to turn to branches of knowledge which they have not been taught to care for—and some teach “by the book”, and seek not to ascertain if the pupil really understands what is there set down. So far as the schools here are concerned I am thinking of offering some kind of premium, whether for the teachers or the pupils I am not sure— but I am disposed to think it must be something that would make the teacher be regarded favourably by the District Inspector, and immediately or remotely tend to give him a higher status, and better his condition. I also have never ceased to urge on the Commissioners of National Education in Dublin the necessity of making Nat. Hist y a regular part of the course of Education in their Training Schools. From the progress that has been made during the last ten years, I do not doubt that these difficulties will be overcome, and on every side pleasant little events are occurring to cheer us on, and make us persevere in our efforts. It gives me great pleasure to think that I am associated in such labours with one whom I esteem so highly as yourself.

{"id": 2803, "text": "When I left Cambridge I fancied that I was on my road to join you at Weymouth, and anticipated great pleasure from the expedition, but as matters now stand it must be put off for the present. I proposed to Rickman that we should make an architectural tour in Normandy together; and I find it will probably suit him to start in a few days, so I shall stay here til this is settled and perhaps executed. I had so fully reckoned on being at Weymouth shortly that I had directed letters to be sent there. I have written to the Post Office to say they maybe sent here; perhaps it may increase the certainly of this being done if you will speak a word about it. I hear from Leonard and Charles Jenyns that you are going on prosperously and that Mrs Henslow is very well and very happy which I am especially pleased to learn. Pray among all your examination of things by land and water have you made one for me anything about the tides? I will tell you one or two points that I want more particularly to have attended to. How are the tides on the two sides of the Bill of Portland? Are they later in the bay of Weymouth or on the side of the Chesil Bank? Are the tides at the same time in shore and out at a distance in the open sea? Is the high water at the point of time when the current in the Channel changes its direction from East to West? If you can get me tolerably precise information on these particular points in addition to any more general observations as I have suggested in the printed paper I shall be very glad. Perhaps with regard to the relative time of the two tides on the two sides of Portland Bill you can note me something down, and if so I should be glad to know it. I was told that you are going to Guernsey. When is this likely to be? If I thought I could fall in with you there I should be much tempted to join you from the side of France. If you go in three weeks or so I dare say it will fall in neatly with my time, but I do not yet know how Rickman's motions will be regulated. I went to St. Albans the other day and saw your family who all appeared to me to be well. I had never seen the Abbey before and a proper lumping piece of old buiding it is. William and Marianne Humfrey are married at last. I saw them start from Cambridge after the ceremony on Thursday last: they cross from Brighton to Dieppe and then travel through France into Italy. When you write let me know what communication there is between Guernsey and Weymouth; for it may be perhaps be possible to come that way from Normandy if one can reckon upon a quick and well timed passage. If I come that way I shall probably bring Rickman with me for I do not think he knows the French lingo and ways well enough to go alone among the monsieurs; so if I take him into the strange land I shall hold myself bound to bring him out. I expect great satisfaction from seeing the impression made upon him by foreign architecture.

I am very anxious that we should do something there worthy of ourselves and our cause and therefore any brief papers you may be pleased to give would be esteemed by me as a personal favour. The leaden coffin as you surmise is rare and interesting. I discovered one last year in Goodman’s Fields, London, which was subsequently destroyed. The lid lapped over like yours and there was a beading [small sketch] at the bottom. One was found by my friend Mons r. De Gerville FSA. at Coutances or near. In it was a glass bottle and a coin of Postumius. [sketch of bottle]. I do not think anything exactly resembling the vault has been found in England. The arrangement of the tiles &c will be very useful when drawn. Have any of the tiles inscriptions? I found one the other day in London. BR.LON I have been to examine the Roman pottery at Dymchurch. They have found fragments of a hundred varieties or more. The discovery is useful in a topographical point of view as shewing, contrary I think to general theory, that in the time of the Romans, this part of Romney marsh was not covered by the sea. The immense quantity of fossils in the stones on the beach would make a visit pleasing to you, & I am sure the Rev M r Issacson would show you every attention, as he did to me. On the summit of the high hill near Folkestone, I excavated part of an urn (with my knife!) The beautiful Roman Pharos h at Dover has recently been walled up so that the interior is now inaccessible.

We were united by so many common pursuits & … & I owe to him so much of what was good & agreeable at Cambridge that I cannot hope my personal loss will now be repaired to say nothing of so abrupt & unlooked for a close to long habits of intercourse & friendship which was continually becoming more intimate– But we may not confine our regret for a man like Ramsay to the loss we ourselves feel of his society - & of his many admirable qualities or to our own private grief at being parted for a time at least from a dear & valued friend: The university; & indeed society at large can ill spare such men: in very few shall we find such a body of real worth, such an unpretending fulfillment of duty, so kindly & social a spirit, so much of the strength which is in quietness & confidence[.] I have long looked on his character with admiration, & with increasing admiration, because I could perceive continual improvement by patient self discipline & by the faithful use of associated means - Others may not have been so clearly aware of this but I have no doubt that you who have known him longer & more intimately than I have are still more convinced of its truth. And it must lighten our grief – for though we see with sorrow & at first with a sort of painful surprise a source of much substantial good & of much innocent enjoyment to very many, so suddenly cut off yet then a light breaks through the cloud & we may perhaps in this case see though darkly what we do in all most undoubtedly believe, that so it is best both for him & for us. That it is so for him requires no effort of faith to feel assured of. God grant that we may fulfil his fatherly intentions to his word &make it so for ourselves by submitting in a childlike spirit to Him & to all his other dispensations even though they should be still more painful to our human feelings – so I would pray to feel – but I am conscious of infinite weakness & I positively dread returning to Cambridge where the forceful associations will renew the sense of loss at every turn. Indeed I must confess though will firstly say this argues anything but patience that my first strong impulse was not to return at all.

With regard to S. fragilis and Russelliana, I almost expect a hoax. What I find about Edinburgh has all narrow leaves and therefore ought to be S. Russelliana. When it grows in a very wet place it is not fragile, but when in a dry place the branches break at the axils at the slightest touch, and all intermediate states of brittleness are to be observed. My observations reduce the species in Smith to about 40!

Hopkins furnished him with these letters, & he allows me to copy them & Ann has just done so & I send them.

I was rather suprised after what you told me that Owen should have returned to show himself at Belfast - & certainly he would be unfit for society if the facts had been as asserted to you. Who was your informant I do not know, but he ought to be undeceived, if deceived he is. The charge that he acted surreptitiously in obtaining his descriptions, & that he asserted he took them from another specimen than Mantells, are clearly disproved or explained away by these letters to Hopkins. I am afraid there must be some pique or rancour against Owen in certain quarters which has induced I know not whom to misrepresent facts this grossly & the least we can do is strenuously to rebut such charges seeing how completely they are disproved.

I never stated that I heard that Owen had   stolen any thing beyond the \"priority of description\" of the Telerpeton (sic) (= Tulerpeton), & had backed his claim by somewhat more that an equivocation. The story told me (so far as I have looked in my memory) was this. Somebody sent to Mantell (for his express use & description, through Lyell) the unique specimen in question. Lyell, in confidence, showed this to Owen, intimating at the time that Mantell was to describe it. Owen was stated to have been seen surreptitiously examining the fossil, after it was sent to the Geol. Soc. & when called on for explanation by the Council, declared he had drawn up his account from another specimen but would not say where this was to be found. I heard all this from Hooker, when naturalists of repute were present & it was admitted as a notorious  fact. But may regard this as strictly confidential, for if the story is founded on misapprehension I should be very sorry to have been the means of carrying it to you without naming me, you can ask Hopkins & other members of the Council what passed at the meeting when Owen is said to have made his refutation, & been accused of unfair dealing - & if you ascertain the statements to be untrue, I shall be very glad to undeceive Hooker & through him whoever were his informants & may have been falsely impressed with these ideas. It is grievious enough to find how O. was prejudiced against Mantell, without supposing he could be guilty of so mean a proceeding. But really one hears so many tales, that it is necessary to be extremely cautious among the London Naturalists - lest some of them be no better than fancies prompted by jealousy and ill humours.

{"id": 2847, "text": "I am to blame & not Annie for neglect in letting you know of the safe arrival of your second kind present. The fact is we have no means of sending to Bury except on Wednesdays & when the carrier enquired for the hamper it had not arrived - & did not till after he had left. So we had to wait another week, & I told Anne I would write when it had turned up at Bury & the bottles were safe in the cellar. You know how occupied minds are apt to forget even such bounden duties as acknowledging presents & will not wonder that altho' it crossed my mind several times to write the occasions were inconvenient & procrastination prevailed. I dare say you will forgive me. Many thanks for attending to Anny's wants & I assure you finds benefit from the physic - which is retained exclusively for her use. I am grieved to hear how weak your digestion must be & the ill consequences that ensue. I find I can't get thro' so much sedentary work as I used to do without dispeptic attacks - but when I take a proper amount of exercise & recreation I can still digest any thing & everything. But I am foolish in often sitting up too late & walking too little - & then my nervous system sets awry & gets my digestive secretions out of order - but I must not grumble at what is so purely my own fault. I find the new arrangements will give me 7 weeks instead of 5 for lectures which I am glad of, as I shall be less hurried & have alternate days for extra work. John Brown of Stanway lately sent me some decomposing vegetable matter from a bed 50 feet below clay which is either Till, (I suppose) more probably re-drifted Till. In this bed he finds remains of Elephant and Rinoceros (near Colchester). He begged me to look at it as he fancied he had found seeds. I examined a piece 1/2 the size of my thumb & picked out about 100 seed vessels & seeds with little bits of beetles & leaves of moss. Some of the seed vessels are very perfect, others much decomposed, but clearly seed vessels, their stalks attached. It takes me too much time to persue the plan I adopted for separating these fruits- I spent six hours over the essay. But when Miss Doorne returns to Hitcham after the holidays I shall set her to work & in a few days I dare say she will separate a few hundred. I have taught her to dissect minute fruits & seeds, & she is preparing such matter for sale, as she has to seek her own livelihood. She does enough (I think) to secure about 3/- for a days work. If you like to venture such a sum for what she can secure from a mass of the Pleistocene peat I'll give her the job as I shall have to give her one for Mr Brown. Nearly or quite one half the mass seems to be small seed vessels - apparently of Juncus, Veronica, perhaps Rumex & other marshy plants. By securing a great many specimens I dare say several forms will be ascertainable. If ever you want minute objects neatly stuck down the aforesaid Miss D. will do it very reasonably to her heart's content. Yrs affecly J .S.

Whether such an idea be right or wrong I can't say, but there are sentences which look wonderfully like private pique, & some that are certainly irrelevant, & unnecessarily sneering: seeing how far the Author really does agree with the idea of succession by modification (in some way or other) of successive generations.

If it be in the power of Man to solve it I hope he will, but in the mean time I think he need not be quite so supercilious upon an honest, hardworking, & painstaking fellow labourer.

{"id": 2862, "text": "Though I have seen one of your circulars before I received the one you sent to me the other day, I have not replied to it, not from any unwillingness to assist you but because a few words from a systematic zoologist like Owen render any suggestions from such as me superfluous— With regard to types of Mammals, our native species are so few, that a local museum might well have them all, as the group where there are two or three examples of a genus or order would give the student information as to the principles of arrangement not only into orders but into smaller divisions— Mammals are divided by Agassiz into 1. Carnivorous 2. Herbivorous 3. Cetaceans— These groups are too large for the purposes of instruction & each can be subdivided by their modes of progression, & it will be found that the limbs & teeth have a certain agreement in their variation— The mere exhibition of stuffed specimens conveys little information and I should in a popular museum, substitute for them in the class of mammals skulls and skeletons of the limbs, preserving to the latter the claws or hoofs but separated a little from the bones as being parts of the dermic skeleton. The maxillary & mandibular bones of the skulls should be particularly opened to show the roots of the teeth—A series of such preparations of our native mammals would convey much instruction. The tarsal or pastern bones of the ruminants with their two complete toes and two rudimentary ones would contrast well with the toes of a wild cat, formed for prehension – and with the fin-like fore limbs of a dolphin & rudimentary pelvis without appendages. All that would be gained by adhering to prominent examples of our divisions (all more or less artificial) can be obtained by conspicuous labels, over a group of specimens illustrating that division—This seems to be the best way with respect to mammals— While I agree with Owen in that the Creator formed all living things in past ages, as well as in the existing order of things, according to a plan and that an endeavour to discover parts of that place is a legitimate exercise of the intellect I think that what in common language is called a “type” must vary according as the group artificially gathered together by the naturalist is more or less extensive— Every species is exactly fitted for the part it is to play in the existing fauna of the word and when we attempt to class the species that we know, by marked differences of the teeth for instance or the limbs or by combinations of these we obtain groups differing very greatly in the number of their species. Owens idea of a type of the vertebrates is a very different thing, being ideal and intended to show how the limbs or appendages belonging to the several sections of the vertebral column may be increased or diminished, or changed in position without associated change of character— The skeleton of a Congereel of a snake of a frog, of a raven, and of a dog would show the bony framework of the five divisions of vertebrats well enough—To illustrate the mammals you might have The great eared bat— Insect. The cat— Carniv. The hare— Rodent. The cow— Rum. The dolphin— Cetac. But as I said in the beginning of my note, the specimens of mammals would not be too numerous were you to include all the native species you can easily procure. For instruction to a rural population I should consider the skulls & limbs of the different breeds of cattle & horses very useful—and if fossil skulls or tarsal bones of the species to be found in the tertiary deposits can be added so much the better—two of the finest fossil skulls of the Bos primigenius that I have seen are preserved in a Museum at Keswick, dug up in the Neighbourhood. The wild oxen & bisons are larger than the domesticated ones, but there is no such difference of size between fossil & existing horses, the modern breeds as far as I have seen being if anything bigger Yours faithfully | John Richardson", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[19, 22, "CARDINAL"], [63, 66, "CARDINAL"], [82, 95, "DATE"], [221, 225, "PERSON"], [417, 420, "CARDINAL"], [424, 429, "CARDINAL"], [602, 609, "ORG"], [615, 616, "CARDINAL"], [630, 631, "CARDINAL"], [645, 646, "CARDINAL"], [648, 657, "NORP"], [1410, 1413, "CARDINAL"], [1432, 1435, "CARDINAL"], [1885, 1889, "PERSON"], [1902, 1909, "PERSON"], [2583, 2588, "PERSON"], [2976, 2980, "CARDINAL"], [3096, 3102, "ORG"], [3114, 3120, "PERSON"], [3149, 3154, "PERSON"], [3568, 3571, "CARDINAL"], [3607, 3610, "PERSON"], [3659, 3676, "ORG"], [3692, 3705, "LOC"], [3925, 3942, "PERSON"]]}

{"id": 2869, "text": "The arrival of another parcel of your rare plants from Kent, lays me under additional obligations, for which I return sincere thanks — they are truly acceptable— I trust you will find something worth your attention in the bundle which I now send you in return— A residence in the Highlands of Scotland for more than two months, tho' much interrupted by wet weather & indisposition, has enabled me to collect & preserve a considerable number of rare plants of that country, some of which cannot fail to be useful for the purpose of forming a part of the various herbaria on which you are now engaged I have also endeavoured to supply the deficiencies of the former collection I sent you, by enclosing good specimens of as many plants growing hereabouts, as I had leisure to dry in the course of the last season, and hope they will not come too late, to be useful— I have much reason to thank you for the introduction to D r Hooker, having experienced much gratification & advantage during the short acquaintance. I have had with him— It was in consequence of his invitation to accompany him to Killin in Perthshire, that I was induced to go so far from home last Summer, otherwise I had concluded to spend the season in Westmorland— As I was not in a condition to bear the fatigues of continued exertion, I thought it best to remain stationary in Killin, rather than take any extensive ramble thro' the Highlands — my collection is on this account not so remarkable for its great variety, as for its containing a plentiful supply of each sort, & gathered in good condition— I could have sent more specimens of Juncus castaneus, Arenaria rubella, Woodsia hyperboria, Alchemilla alpina, Gnaphalium supinum, Juncus trifidus, Trientalis europæa, Sibbaldia procumbens, Veronica saxatilis, Tofieldia palustris, Carex capilllaris, C. atrata, Cornus Suecica, and Myosotis alpestris, without at all impoverishing my collection, but as I have not yet distributed any among my friends, I thought it best to retain a sufficient supply, & only send you so much as I thought would be really wanted— Should, therefore, a further supply of any of them be at all desirable, you will only have to mention it, in order that I may retain, all that can conveniently be spared, to be sent you at some future opportunity— I am greatly-delighted with your new plant Althaea hirsuta; and wild specimens, so beautifully dried, are highly welcome— I learn from Sir J E Smith, that Isnardia palustris has been lately found growing wild in Sussex, by M r W. Borrer— I was much pleased with your account of the Cowslip & its change, by particular management, to the state of the Oxlip — It had never struck me that Viola hirta & odorata were so nearly related, before you communicated to me your suspicions of the fact — on comparison of the two plants there exists an extraordinary similarity between them, and you are probably in the right— It may confirm your opinion, to be told, that I learned from M r Bentham (whom I saw at D r Hookers) that the flowers of Viola hirta in France, has sometimes the fragrance of V. odorata— I have never observed this circumstance in Wales— M r Roberts I understand is more closely occupied than ever with his professional engagements but he faithfully promises to spend a few days in a botanical excursion with me if I visit Bangor during the winter, which I intend for the purpose of collecting mosses. The parcel for him will be very acceptable I know; & I will take care that he receives it before long.— Lemna gibba has been again fertile, & I have preserved a few more specimens, and collected a quantity of seeds for D r Hooker— L. minor I observed in flower, for the first time, in June last— I think this species hardly ever ripens produces perfectly mature seeds — I was not able to procure any— While in the Highlands I was fortunate enough to detect the real fructification of Jungermannia Blasia—it was in a very early stage, but sufficiently obvious, to satisfy me that it was a Jungermannia— All the specimens I found (about two or three at the most), I dissected; and so, cannot send away— Carex curta is abundant about Killin, & occurs in swampy ground in the vallies, as well as near the summits of the mountains, at an elevation of 3500 feet— While at D r Hookers, I had the pleasure of seeing M r Winch of Newcastle from whom I was glad to know, you had received & specimens of Cypripedium calceolus— I hardly expect to find it in Lancashire— The specimen of Galium (a duplicate of which you have from me, if I mistake not) gathered near Pen MaenMawr in Caernarvonshire, & abundant in various parts of Wales, which I sent to Sir J E Smith, I am informed is \"certainly is G. Witheringii, of a remarkably large size—\" I still think it nothing more than the rough variety of G. palustre, occurring frequently about Warrington— I was in hope to be able to send you Gentiana nivalis from Ben Lawers, but I searched in vain for a third specimen— one of the two which I did find, I left with D r Hooker, who had never before been able to obtain it, and who, as the Author of the Flora Scotica, might be said to have the strongest claim to possess it— of every other plant which I found in the Highlands I believe I have sent you duplicates, with the exception of some common mosses, &c— with best wishes I remain | Yours very faithfully | W.

Campbell Vicar of Eye, which can’t be put off as M rs Campbell expects very soon to be confined. I regret the more not having the pleasure of seeing you while we are in Suffolk, as I wanted to ask you if the flight of the Bean Aphid, which seems to have been very general about a month ago in the South of & West of England, extended to your parish, & if so, whether it seemed a true infection from a distance like many of those of this tribe, or second, or simply on quitting the Beans to settle on other plants in the immediate neighbourhood; & in either case whether you conceive the object of the movement to have been mainly the search for fresh food, or the deposition of eggs by the winged females of the last generation. If this last were their great object, it would be highly desirable to ascertain where the eggs are placed, as they cannot be placed on the beans on which the larvae to be hatched from them next spring, are to feed. How much we have yet to learn as to this part of the economy of Aphids, seems proved by a fact (if correct) lately ascertained to me by Mr. Walker, who says he has ascertained that the eggs of the Hop Aphis are deposited on the Sloe, from which the first or second brood in Spring migrates to the Hop– “a good hop” as my venerable friend who has happily not lost his relish for a pun, observed when I told him of this. I was surprised to find on looking a little into this matter, previous to a discussion we had on it at the last meeting of the Entomological Society, how vague & imperfect our actions are of the habits & economy & indeed physiology of the Aphids. Even Prof. Owen hardly lays it down in his “Comparative Anatomy” that all the 8 or 9 generations of viviparous females in summer, are wingless, except the last, yet we all see winged females on the Rose from very early in Spring  & I saw a lecture on the subject in the Phill Transs explicitly say that the 2d generation of the species he made his observations on, is winged. I wish M. r Jenyns, to whom pray present my best regards when you see him, would turn his attention to this obscure subject. Pray also tell him that in a beam of oak so pierced with insect holes that it has been necessary to remove it from the top of the vestry window in Barham Church, to which Sir W.

Kirby’s for examination, I have found one entire, & 3 mutilated specimens of Anobium tessalatum – the same insect of which the larvae attacked the beams of the houses at Brussels I referred to at Oxford & which I have no doubt have been the cause of the mischief in this instance.

I expected to have been down there ere this but circumstances seem likely to prevent my going before the new year. Anything I have to send you from there I can hand to my friend Mr Wilson of Warrington who I believe sometimes sends packets to you. My late trip into Somerset was tolerably productive of good plants but I had the mortification to lose nearly the whole of my specimens owing to the papers not being changed. You will see what a shocking state some of the specimens now sent are in from that cause. In travelling on foot (which I do for my health & the greater convenience of botanizing) I find it impossible to carry my collection with me but am obliged to forward the packet to some town I fix on as head quarters. When any delay takes place in the delivery of these or I do not reach the place at the time I expected they sometimes suffer materially. I lost about 100 specimens of Reseda alba from an undoubtedly wild habitat on the Somerset coast & my specimens of Chrysocoma linosyris shared very much the same fate though not so irretrievably injured.

This is of course a large field to enter upon, but I have no intention of illustrating what I want to say, except in reference to birds: just tell me, however, whether I am right in saying that the Herbert Experiments, showing the primrose, cowslip, &c— to be all on species,— have never been disproved. —And if you have anything at hand of equal importance with this, in the botanical departm t,— worth communicating, make a note of it, & bring it with you.

We leave Sidmouth on the 24 th and after spending about one week at Mr Northmores (Cleve Exeter) proceed northwards. My brother in law Sir A. Eden from the state of his new house can only see us at a particular time, and we must consequently regulate our motions to suit the convenience, to a certain extent, of the friends we have promised to visit on our way– Two plans of mine are thus given up, perhaps, for prudence’ sake it is as well they should be; – an excursion to Cornwall and a visit to London (the latter would have taken in Cambridge). In all this however I am disappointed, but it cannot be helped. The climate of Edinburgh is so trying to persons with at all delicate lungs, in the winter and spring, that we have come to the resolution of leaving it either this autumn or sometime next year, and you may easily conceive how uncomfortable we felt at the present moment in not being able to arrange anything about a matter of such importance to us. If the climate of Liverpool should prove sufficiently mild it strikes me as the best place for my pursuits between Edinburgh and London. It has a Bot. Garden – a Lyceum of literature and science – a sea port for my foreign communications – a population which I sh. d think would support an annual course of lectures – and a centrical situation. I shall reconnoitre as I go north.

It is provoking to see some rare species just beginning to grow as I leave the place. I have laid in a great stock of many & shall render the collection I sent you more perfect. Have you heard anything about the destination of Sir J. E. Smith's collection? He kept the Linnean one separate from his own – where does the former go? Pray do not forget your intention of asking your brother to look after the ferns at Monte Video– If he has an opportunity of collecting marine algæ nothing is easier to preserve them– give them a squeeze with the hand & spread them widely between two boards without a weight and without paper – Of the specimens preserved in this way in New Holland – I have not failed once in restoring them.

{"id": 2900, "text": "I regret much that it is not in my power to accompany my friend Dr. Graham to London this Spring, and to Cambridge en passant, as I had last Spring the pleasure of visiting Oxford with my other friend & Professor Dr. Hooker: but I cannot resist the opportunity of writing you by him, in the hope of some time or other procuring from you a few of the rarer British species of plants that are to be found in your neighbourhood. But I will be frank with you in saying that I have not much to offer you – Scottish plants my friend Graham can give you as well as I can, and of my South of France plants my duplicates are sadly reduced – my principles as a Botanist have always been to give when I can give, and to sow information let who will reap the fruit. Of course then out of about 3½ stone of dried plants I brought from the South of France, Pyrenees, Spain and Switzerland, about four years ago, my stock after serving my own herbarium and about 25 or 30 correspondents or friends has been so much reduced that my plantae rariores have long since vanished whilst my others I am almost ashamed to offer. Pray I know not how to make a selection for you, for perhaps you have all of them already, but if Graham could induce you to visit our modern– (I had almost said Athens but the dismal recollection that we have not half a dozen of Botanists in our whole population bids me refrain from giving that absurd appellation to “Auld Reekie”. I say if Graham can induce you to pay us in the North a visit, nothing would give me greater pleasure than bidding you help yourself out of my duplicates. All I wish in return (and if you don’t wish to gain anything in return – c’en fait rien – you are still welcome to my duplicates) is your assistance to complete my specimens of the British flora. For through want of correspondents in the chalky districts of England, my herb. am is woefully deficient in British specimens of many plants that I have myself gathered on the Continent. Would a collection of well named mosses or sea-weeds give you any pleasure? I observe you have described an old discovery(?) of mine in the leaves of Malaxis paludosa– I and an old friend of mine (Mr. D. Stewart) long since saw the same thing, but I had always suspicions that the appearance was long since described. I cannot at present refer to the work, but that was the only reason why we never published our ideas: indeed what is remarkable that it was these glandular bodies or rather gemmae for they actually give rise to young plants, that made me recognize the species when Mr. Stewart & I discovered it on the Cleish Hills in 1820. Do you find it abundantly? If so I would wish much for a specimen or two for the sake of the locality. Have you found M. Loeselii? I have no British specimens although I could give you a Swiss one– With regard to their being parasitic I have doubts if in the true sense of the word any Orchideous plant is so. That is, I have doubts if any one of the tribe draws its entire nourishment from another plant– Most of the Orobancheae are truly parasitical; one cannot raise them in earth– but all the Orchideous plants may be raised either in earth or bogmoss (Sphagnum): indeed I feel confident that Malaxis paludosa does not insert a single radicular fibre within the epidermis of any plant whatever, whether of the A- Mono- or Di-cotyledoneous tribes of vegetables. But my introductory, and perhaps (but as you please) valedictory letter has drawn too much on your patience so allow me to call myself Yours truly | G.A.W. Arnott [P.S.] I beg to send you one or two brochures – Of the work I published in 1825 in Paris on the Mosses– and of my memoirs in the Wern.

The more so, as I particularly wished your opinion upon 2 or 3 botanical questions, of some importance to my present studies. One of these, however, more important than the others, I shall now trouble you with. Botanists, I believe, generally admit the three great divisions of the Vegetable world to be natural; namely Dicotyledones, Monocotyledones, and Acotyledones. It appears, however, that other Botanists, among whom M srs Fries and Agardh stand conspicuous, conceive that the last named division, is much too comprehensive, and have therefore divided the Acotyledones, into three Classes, or groups, of equal value with the Dicotyledones & Monocotyledones, naming them―Protophyta, Hysterophyta and Pseudo-cotyledonea. How far have these preceding latter divisions of the Vegetable Kingdom been adopted? and where are the reasons, for or against their admission to be found? Next, I would enquire, are there real certain groupes or genera, or species, among the Acotyledones, which, in their nature, partake so much of those characters belonging to Pseudo-cotyledones, and to the Hysterophyta, or Fungi, that some doubts may be reasonably entertained under which they should be arranged? or at least, that their immediate affinities, to one or the other, are real, at first sight, unquestionably apparent? If so; what genera are the [over  genera] names of these genera or species. I shall feel particularly obliged by as many details, as your time or inclination will allow you to give me upon this interesting subject and if you have no objection I should wish to mention your name as the source of my authority as these questions relate to an earlier portion of my Introduction to the second Volume of the \"Northern Zoology,\" I shall be most thankful to receive your communication at your earliest convenience. In referencing the foregoing queries I think it better, perhaps, to put the principal question in aother shape. Is there not a greater apparent affinity between the Pseudocotyledones and the Hysterophyta. than there is between either the first and the Dicotyledones? or between the Hysterophyta and the Monocotyledones? I send you the Prospectus of a Botanical work for which I entreat the patronage of your circle of friends at Cambridge, on behalf of the fair painter of Lilies. I can safely say that if it is published the excellence of the Plates will exceed any that either England or France have produced. I have no other than a friendly interest in its success and therefore beg for Subscriptions without any shame. I have thought the first volume of my Illustrations might go in the Packet and be a subject of interest at your next Scientific Party. It is a select copy, and should any one desire the purchase you could bring me the proceeds when next you visit S t Albans. I had the pleasure of seeing your brother in law Mr Jenyns about 10 days ago but very much regretted his visit was but for a few minutes.

I cannot flatter myself that my correspondence can be in the smallest degree important to you, but it will certainly give me much pleasure to support it. I can scarcely persuade myself that you are so much behind in your botanical studies as you would have it believed, seeing you have taken the Bull so stoutly by the horns as to threaten publication already. I have never been bold enough, or active enough, for this, tho' I have been lecturing for ten years, - for a quarterly list of the new & rare plants which flower in the botanic Garden here, & which I describe in the Edin. new Philosophical journal, does not enable me to say I have not been totally negligent of appearing in print. There is not at this University anything deserving the name of a herbarium, but I am labouring hard to form one; I fear therefore I cannot be so great a contributor to yours as I would wish, but I shall certainly be able to spare you a few which I think you would like. Besides the University Herbarium, which I always consider myself bound to attend to in the first instance, I have also a herbarium of my own, which is however only in embryo. The arrangements I have made will I think enable me in a few years to accumulate duplicates, but at present I really have very few. August is about the only month in which I can leave Edin., but annually at this period I take a ramble in the highlands, & hereafter I shall not on these excursions forget that you have expressed a wish to have some Scotch plants. Will your zeal ever carry you among our Mountains. If so I wish you could contrive to encounter wind & rain & all kind of privations, in my company. I should pilot you with singular pleasure among scenes of such beauty, & great botanical interest. Almost without exception, I start for the north every 2d of August, the day after the close of my academical labours. I can answer for Grevelles readiness to assist you in those departments of practical botany to which he has paid particular attention.

{"id": 2919, "text": "I had the pleasure of receiving your letter when particularly engaged, and therefore could not say in reply, till today, that I have prepared a parcel of Cryptogamous plants for your acceptance. I well know the value of doing things of this kind speedily and were it not that I am obliged at this time to calculate my very moments you would receive a larger collection.  As it is, I have gone through my duplicates of British Mosses - which is the most perfect part of my trading collection. Of course some specimens are indifferent - but where I have only bad ones I have given you them  rather that none. You will find most of our rarest species. I shall send the parcel by an early opportunity to your Brother's care in London. My parcels I generally receive through Baldwin Cradock & Joy, Pater Noster Row. Before quitting the mosses I must mention that many of the specimens require cleaning & washing & pressure before placing in the Herbarium - as they have been generally preserved in walking tours - in the rough. I am extremely glad that my letter contained any matter in the least serviceable to you - & in the same spirit I shall reply to you questions regarding Drawing & Demonstrations, and in the former, being an old hand, I may save you time & trouble. I rarely if ever use Indian Ink. The outline of my drawing (say the capsule of a moss) I make very strong, by the common very soft black lead pencils. I then proceed to shade with the same using the point broad and working very rapidly - mostly in the hatching manner //////. Now for the coloring - this must be done with a full brush and plenty of color. Anything almost does to shade with- but as a general rule use sepia along with the ground color - & if great depth is wanted add indigo. A sine qua non is prepared gall - a little of which dissolved in water and used pretty freely, makes the colors float as if the paper was damped. When you get into the way of it, you'll be able to put nearly the whole light & shade in one wash. Have your colors in separate saucers - and two or three glasses of water - so that in a large leaf passing from brown at the point, through yellow in the middle to green at the base, you may be able to graduate the shades without interruption.  In a broad wash, always keep a wave of color as it were, following the brush. I shall fill up the next page with illustrations on a small scale which will illustrate in part what I have said. By Demonstration, I meant placing in the hand of every student a specimen similar to the one in the hand of the lecturer - sometimes only a small protion of a plant is requisite for the object in view - but what I chiefly alluded to, was the demonstration of a complete specimen - 3-5 of which would occupy half an hour. It is in fact reading a full description of the plant, - so leisurely as to enable students to examine every part and follow the description. I cannot help thinking if you try this method you will regard it as the most efficient part of the course.  I doubt if you will hardly compress your course into 12 lectures. Humboldt is the chief authority of the Geography of Plants - but you will find a few interesting papers in Jameson's Phil. Journ. from Schouw's Danish work - and a curious distribution of plants by the same author, translated in Brester's Journ. of Science no 7 & 8. An interesting Essay on the distribution of Marine Algae by Lamouroux is in the Annales des Science Nat. for Jany. 1826. (you will find the essence of it inserted by me in the Edin. Journ. of Medical Science No 5). By the way, there is an excellent historical sketch of the history of Bot. Geography in the prospectus of the new work on that subject now in progress by Humboldt. It is inserted in the Bulletin des Sciences Naturel for 1826 - but I cannot say which number, as my copy is binding. Impressions of leaves have a very good effect - but are too small for a lecturer to use in the classroom. The leaf of Hydrocotyle vulgaris  for instance should not be less 12 inches in diameter - and then serves 3 purposes to show an orbicular leaf, a peltate leaf, and a crenate margin.  These figures are very carelessly done but they will shew the mode of execution - the moss capsule wants a little more shade, but I leave it as it is to shew the effect of one operation - (the calyptra was touched twice). NB wash from light to dark generally - at least on broad surfaces.  Next month the 1st no. of the Icones Filicum will be out, by Hooker & myself -I hope you will be pleased with it. The plates for the 2nd are engraved. Pray use your interest to procure suscribers for its encouragement (Hooker & I derive no profit by it) as it costs Trettel & Wurtz some money to get it up.

{"id": 2922, "text": "I don't know whether you care to hear Phillips, who delivers the Rede Lecture in the Senate House next Tuesday at 2 PM. It is understood that he means to attack the Darwinian hypothesis of natural selection. Sedgwick's address last Monday was temperate enough for his usual mode of attack but strong enough to cast a slur upon all who substitute hypotheses for strict induction, & as he expressed himself in regard to some of C.Ds suggestions as revolting to his own sense of wrong & right & as Dr Clark who followed him, spoke so unnecessarily severely against Darwin's views; I got up, as Sedgwick has alluded to me, & stuck up for Darwin as well as I could, refusing to allow that he was guided by any but truthful motives, & declaring that he himself believed he was exhalting & not debasing our views of a Creator, in attributing to him a power of imposing laws on the Organic World by which to do his work, as effectualy as his laws imposed upon the inorganic had done it in the mineral kingdom. I believe I succeeded in diminishing if not entirely removing the chances of Darwin's being prejudged by many who take their cue in such cases according to views of those they suppose may know something of the matter. Yesterday at my lectures I alluded to the subject, & showed how frequently naturalists were at fault in regarding as species forms which had (in some cases) been shown to be varieties, & how legitimately Darwin had deduced his inferences from positive experiment. Indeed I had, on Monday, replied to a sneer (I don't mean from Sedgwick) at his pigeon results, by declaring that the case necessitated  an appeal to such domestic experiments & this was the legitimate & best way of proceeding for the detection of those laws which we are endeavouring to discover. I do not disguise my own opinion that  Darwin has pressed his hypotheses too far - but at the same time I assert my belief that his Book is (as Owen described it to me) the \"Book of the Day\". I suspect the passages I marked in the Edinburgh Review for the illumination of Sedgwick have produced an impression upon him to a certain extent. When I had had my say, Sedgwick got up to explain, in a very few words, his good opinion of Darwin, but that he wished it to be understood that his chief attacks were directed aginst Powell's late Essay, from which he quoted passages as \"from an Oxford Divine\" that would astound Cambridge men as no doubt they do. He showed how greedily, (if I may so speak) Powell has accepted all Darwin had suggested, & applied these suggestions (as if the whole were already proved) to his own views. I think I have given you a fair , tho' very hasty, view of what happened & as I have just had a letter form Darwin, & really have not a minute to spare for a reply this morning perhaps you will send this to him, as he may like to know, to some extent, what happened. As he also wishes to know of all criticisms, pro & con, he will find an adverse view in the last No (just received) of the Dublin Magazine of Natural History. Of course he knows of the reply to Owen in a late Saturday Magazine & also the articles in the Spectator.  Let me know as soon as you conveniently can whether my ideas of the Palace Lectures met yours. Every lecturer must, of course, be guided to a considerable extent by his own. But there may lie something or other which he has neglected, or is not aware of, that would induce him to modify his plans - I have only a fortnight more here, & have to select such materials as I think maybe useful from the Museum here & pack them up so I have not much time to spare. A few words will be enough to set me thinking & if these Lectures are to come off I should wish to make them as instructive or suggestive (as well as agreeable ) as 4 lectures may admit, & my opportunities allow. I must now have 100 auditors here the room is so full; & above 50 seem likely to try for a Pass this year.

And there it is difficult to say what is to be assigned to mistakes in the press & what to the barbarous latinity of Botanists.

In the last line of the page are Plumbaginaceae & Plantaginaceae, the one from Plumbago the other from Plantago. Surely they ought to be Plumbagineae and Plantagineae. In the next page L.2. Thymelaceae is derived from Thymelaea, & therefore ought to be Thymelaeaceae. L.3 Salicaceae is given as the adjective from Salix, which surely ought to be Salicineae. L.8.

I wish I could be the means of bringing you & him together, that you might tell him what you do & how you do it. He tells me he is not likely to be much in London this season, as he has the Bishopric of Durham also on his hands at present; but if I find him in Town I will let you know. The rejection of Lord J.

The second cause is rather too long an exposure to the Mercury, & then it is an additional crop of larger particles equally dispersed over the surface, but at considerable distance from each other comparatively.

I am gratified too with the prospect of your coming to Scotland & of my thus being able to make your personal acquaintance. I wished to have done so two months ago when I spent some time in England. I hoped to have gone by Oxford & have returned by Cambridge. The former I accomplished. The latter I could not:- for as usual, I found myself much hurried immediately previous to coming away from London. … Graham who spent a few days with me last week told me of the plan you had in view for visiting Scotland. My excursions to the Highlands with the Students will be the latter end of June. It depends upon the Sacrament of the Parish in which the Lectures are given, which I think is necessarily a vacation from the duties of the Class. This year I shall start on the 23 d (tuesday.) We go down the Clyde to Dumbarton to breakfast:― Take the public conveyance to Balloch at the lower end of Loch Lomond & get the steamer to take us to the head of the Lake by 2 in the afternoon. Then, we are only 26 miles from Killin, where there is accommodation for our party, & that distance we have usually walked: but I think I shall order some sort of vehicles to meet us & convey us the last ten or 12 of these miles. Killin as you know is at the head of Loch Tay & at the foot of some of the best of the Breadalbane Mountains. We ascend the nearest on wednesday.— take Ben Lawers perhaps on the thursday. Some other one in the vicinity on the friday & return on the Saturday. I expect our friend Wilson of Warrington will be here unless, poor fellow, he should have a fit of the Blue d—ls.

But so tormented by hypochondriasis that he makes himself miserable for weeks together. M r. Christy too is coming from London & they too probably will stop a few days longer than I can do, tied as I am to my Class. So that, if you choose it, you can devote more time to the Breadalbane M ts– & you cannot do it under better auspices than those of M r. Wilson. Douglas too I expect will be here & M r. Arnott of Edinburgh. I hope you will continue to be here at the time. Brown has promised to come in the Autumn: but he has often promised to do before; & not performed his promise. We never can be sure of him. I will write at once to Drummond that he may prepare a set in 2 vol s. 4 to of his Maps of N. America. The price is 3 g s.—260 or 270 kinds:— & most beautiful! He has more orders than he can immediately supply & this book will soon be a great rarity. Plate 25 of Bot. Miscellany was omitted by mistake & will be given extra with Part II.

The Engravings for N o. 2 are all ready & the first sheet is already printed. In speaking of our friend Lowe, \"Cryptogamma\" aut to have been Gymnogamma.

In the middle of the glen and, of course, of the rain, I met Power, Thomas, and two other men I think both of Cambridge who were doing their duty of as seers of sights no less resolutely than Airy and myself.

Mrs Airy was is a  one of our companions in the expedition of which this was a portion, but she fortunately avoided all the rainy part of our travels.

I hope I shall see young Mr Henslow one day on his tour on the continent. Your appointment as Prof. of Botany & the reorganisation and removal of the botanical garden have given me likewise very great satisfaction, and I wish from all my heart, you may always find that happiness in your family, and in nursing and conversing with Flora's children, which most of their friends enjoy. I feel very much obliged for your having been so kind to introduce to me Prof. Whewell, with whom I spent some very agreeable hours, & who was kind enough to forward this letter together with the packet of dried plants. - The second collection of Brittish plants, which you favoured me with by Mr Jacob, contained a great deal of very interesting plants. I tell you my best thanks, and would be very much obliged to you, if you could procure me some duplicates of those, which I shall mention at the end of this letter. Practice & medical employment in general prevent me from studying much botany,however I try to find out now and then some minutes to dedicate to it. Adding to this that I have been married about three months ago, you will excuse my not having made up for you a richer collection than you will you find in the joint packet. I added some cryptogamics which perhaps will not be disagreeable to you. - I inclosed two catalogues of dried plants, which are to be sold, & which my friends DDr. Preppig & Sadler asked me to communicate to my Correspondents. The price of the small American plants (200 specm) is £3.8.., of the small hungarian taken at Leipzig £1.10. the specimens of both are very fine, and the tickets of the american ones printed as you may see in the catalogue.

I felt however much better for the little outing I had, & am now as well as I was before my illness.— What think you of Darwin’s book?— Perhaps, however you saw it all in mss. He was good enough to send me a copy, which I am reading with great avidity;— I have not as yet had time to get far, but agree with him in a great deal of what I have mastered. Still I fear he is prepared to go to such lengths that we shall part company, in regard to our views about species, before I reach the last chapter of his work. Is he really prepared inclined to the opinion — that all animals & plants have descended from one prototype, —say— as the reviewer in last Saturday’s Athenaeum says, — that “a cabbage (or anything else I suppose) may have been the parent plant, — a fish the parent animal. If too there has never been any subsequent creation of species since the protozoic ages, how does he get over the fact of man’s existence, without holding him to be a mere modified monkey! In the same Athenaeum above alluded to, I read with interest your letter on the ‘Celts in the flint”; — but I do not quite understand your “younger man”, who first says he is “positive that some (celts) had occurred in the bed where the fossils are met with”, — & afterwards, on being closer questioned by you, says “They (who believed this) must be very simple-folk to think so, &c.—” Is there nor some contradiction here between his two statements?— Have you heard that Hope, who presented all his Entomological collections & Books to the University of Oxford a few years back, now comes forward with an offer to found and endow a Zoological Professorship there, if they will accept it. The thing is not done yet in a formal way, —but if adopted & carried out, I hope Cambridge will in due time follow the example.— Is anything more stirring on the subject of new museums, &c— My wife is much as usual, & joins in kind love to Louisa & yourself.— Yours affectly— | L.

On Monday night I was in perfect wretchedness from irritation & felt as if someone was playing St Vitus’ jig all night behind my pillow. I never closed my eyes in slumber. Saturday night I was not much better for I only slept thro’ powerful opiates & had a succession of disgusting & frightful dreams. On Wednesday I came round again & thank God I am now very well again.

I wish with all my heart I could come to you but it is quite impossible My left arm does good service but in dressing & undressing I am as helpless as an infant.

The “Herbarium” which consists of 18 or 19 Packages of Dried Flowers & Plants, cultivated and wild, and some seeds is soldered down in a Leaden Case to preserve them from Damp. In the other package which is covered with Mat, are several Bottles of Specimens of Reptiles, Insects, Fish and Fruit in Spirits, model of a Chinese Lady: Foot – 2 Boxes (of “Crustacea) Shark’s Fin – &c &c – also 80 Small Jars of different Flower Seeds, the latter for the Cambridge Botanical Garden, the former for the Museum of your Philosophical Society – Many particulars repeating the above I entered into, when writing to Leonard Jenyns a short time since.

It was brought me from Malacca; it is written by D. o G. M. Ward Assistant Surgeon in the 35 th Foot and promises I think to prove a very interesting Production, the 4 Tribes of the Aboriginese live in the dead of the Forest, living entirely on the Fruits found therein, and upon what they take in hunting, – “they neither sow nor plant any thing”. – These wild people have no Religion, nor the slightest idea of a Supreme Being, Creation of the World &c– Affixed to the work will be an Appendix (a sheet of which I have also got.) containing a “Table of Fruits found in the Bazaar at Malucca” it describes no less than 100 different kinds, with the Malayan & Linnaean Names attached. Amongst them is the far famed “Mangusteem”, in speaking of which Dr Ward, observes “it is rather curious that the “Habitat” of it, is so extremely limited, we do not believe “that it extends further Northward than the Old Fort of “Tenasserim, in Lat.11°., 40 s and all attempts to cultivate “it on the Continent of India have failed”.

The truth is, lecturing is not at all my vocation, I find it a great exertion & a great fatigue, & I have therefore almost resolved not to attempt it except at Bury & Mildenhall, where I am as it were at home. Moreover, of the 3 days you name, it so happens that February 10 is the very day fixed for my own lecture at Bury, & on Jan 13 Mr Kingsley is engaged to deliver a lecture there, which I am particularly anxious to hear. But we should be extremely glad to see you here, lecture or no lecture, at any time this winter that you can come; & I hope that you may yet be able to manage it, although you do seem to be formidably beset with engagements. As for lectures, having so many to deliver, I should think you must be tolerably sick of them.

His letters have been full of most interesting & important & curious geological information, the pith of which will no doubt enrich the next editions of his Principles & Manual.

That might be the case, at least to a considerable extent, but when the coil arises, the remedy should be applied. The best remedy would be, to give the Committee of Council power to order a rate to be levied when the voluntary sum was not forthcoming, the schools in all such cases to be practically and really free from all religious compulsion of any sort.

I have made a number of unsuccessful attemps to procure specimens of Rattle snakes and alligators. The first are very scarce in the more thickly [inhabited] parts of our country or at least in the State of New Jersey and the second are only found in the southern states. Three of the young men who have graduated at our college have promised that they would forward an alligator for you but as yet they have failed to keep their promis. I am informed by one that it is a difficult matter to send one alive to England although they are frequently sent apparently in good health to New York.

We find great difficulty in this country in getting our labours properly noticed in Europe but in reference to my last papers I have had little to complain of on this account. They have met with a very favourable reception in France and Germany and have been immediately republished in England. We are very disagreeably situated in this country in reference to the prosecution of science. The unrighteous custom of reprinting English books without paying the authors has a most pernicious and paralizing influence on the effor[t]s of native literary talent. The American author can get no remuneration for his labours for why should the book seller pay for the copy right of an American work when he can get one on the same subject which will sell better, from England for nothing. Besides this the man of science can scarcely hope to get proper credit for his labours since all his reputation must come from Abroad through the medium of the English republications and it is not in the nature of things that the compiler of a scientific work should be as much inclined to give as full credit to a stranger in a distant count[r]y as to a neabour at his elbow. It is surprising how much noterity such  men as Dr La  the compiler of pop English popular works get in this country. Dr. Lardener was before he came to  this country  here was a much greater man than Herschell. Speaking of Lardner reminds me that I have to thank you for the alteration that was made in  the report  his account of my communication to the mechanical section of the British association in 1837. You may reccollect that he gave me the Lie in reference to the speed of American boats before the whole section and afterward made  some  rather a disparaging  remark  insinuation in reference to the nature of my communication. I do not [?exult] in  his  the misfortune he has brought on himself but regard him rather  as an  as  the  an ob[j]ect of pit[y] than of  anger  resenmt.  He has met no  He has met with no encouragement from scientific men of any standing in our country. He has adopted the [?position] of an itineran[t] lecturer and during the past winter has managed to  get  draw tollerably large audiences in the theaters of New York by  alternating  occuping the stage on  different  alternate nights with jugles and public dancers at from 6 d to a shilling sterling per head, and with this as an indication of the state of morals among us I am pleased. He is certainly a very interesting writer and a man of considerable talent but he has  always  sadly been wanting in  one  an essential element of  the  a  Philosoph  scientific character  the  a sacred regard to truth. I hold that no person can be trusted as the historian of sci[ence] who could be guilty of the crime of which he is charged. Perhaps I have now said to much in reference to this paramour yet I do assure you that although I dislike his character I regard him as an object of pity. He gave an account in one of his Lectures in Phil d. of his treatment of me at the British association and attributed the whole to a mistake. Although his lecture was published in the papers I took no notice of it.

I mean that after having done so, I shall look to them for renumerating the charges of packing Cases, Jars, Spirits &c &c– Indeed in my present circumstances I could not with prudence venture on the charges of such a removal unless with the certain prospect of renumeration for all such expences. You will probably be able to ascertain this point for me, w. ch ascertained, will leave me at far greater liberty in collecting than I conceive myself at present authorized to exercise. A collection of the Fishes, for instance cannot be formed without considerable expence, w. ch I cannot undertake on my own account. Observe I do not request & would not accept  anything in the form of a subscribed salary for the purpose of collecting (call it pride if you like), but what I want is a sort of carte blanche to incur a few expences for the Society as well as a prospect of renumeration for what I may incur in transmitting to them my present & future private Collections intended ultimately for their acceptance. It must therefore be clearly understood that any funds raised for this purpose are to be claimed on the ground of promoting the interests of the Cam. Phil. Soc: – not on those of private friendship or well-wishing to myself; for on such I say beforehand I w. d on no account accept them.

I have made arrangements with this House for the transmission of packages and should you wish hereafter to send me anything it will come safely and with \"dispatch\" through this channel. You will find in the package the last No of the Flora of North America, which as yet has been published. I have sent you in succession the several nos. of this work as they have appeared and you will oblige me by informing me in your next letter if your set is complete up to this time. I have received from you during the past year two packages the one containing your letters on agriculture and the other your account of the Roman antiquities found at Rougham. The letters on agriculture came in very good time. We have lately established an agricultural society in this state of which I am a member and therefore it behoves me to learn something of the subject. I think your letters admirably fitted for the object for which they were intended and I have read them with much pleasure and instruction. I have made several ineffectual attempts to procure an Alligator for you. Several of my pupils on their return to the south have attempted to send on one to me but the animal has died or has been lost in the transportation. A few years ago two were sent from New Orleans to Professor Jager which came safely and I supposed I would find no difficulty in getting one for you in the same manner but I have not been so fortunate. Many thanks to you for your kind invitation to visit your parsonage. I have not the least doubt from past experience that I would be made \"right welcome\" but at present I have not the most distant idea of ever visiting England again. If however by any unforseen circumstances I sh[ould] ever again cross the Great Deep I sho[uld] certainly not leave England without visiting you. I know not if you are still in the line of mineralogy but I send you a specimen of uniaxial mica from Orange Co. state of New York. The biaxial variety is very common but this I send is rare in the United States. By polarized light the single axis is readily determined. The recollections of my visit to Cambridge are of the most pleasurable kind and this pleasure is renewed every time I hear from you. I hope therefore although our communications may be short and far between that they may be continued through life. I hope in the course of a few months to be able to send you some of the results of my late researches in electricity and other subjects in Natural Philosophy.

If I were asked in a general way whether I gotten many new plants I should say I had, & that I should be able to add a great many things to my own collection, perhaps quite as many as I ever expected to do this time when I cannot be said to have hardly begun botanizing yet here which is the chief place I ever had in view:— But whether I shall add anything to your collection already so extensive compared with mine is a very doubtful point. I trust however that I shall do even this in one or two instances.— The following are a few things which I remember amongst others:— the word new means that I never had or found before.— ….  A new Scirpus or Schoenus.— Veronica montana — very scantily at Hastings Beta maritima — I believe but am not certain A new Umbellif. — most probably Oenanthe croc A new Linum.— Two or three new Arenarias A new Thlaspi— a nice thing.— Genista tinctoria— I rather think A new Cardamine — most prob ly  hirsuta A new Hieracium - seems to answer to sylvaticum Carduus tenuiflorus — I am almost certain — rare Prenanthes muralis - several very nice specimens Ornithopus perpusillus - I had none before....\"   Besides these I have no doubt there are a few which I have forgotten.– also a lot of grasses, all new to me, some of them probably maritime.– 3 or 4 new ferns.– a tolerably sized packet. of nice conferva, ulva from Hastings, amongst which are some nice ones: – I did them all up separately as carefully as I could & the time would allow, but they were all very wet & it is very doubtful what state they will be in when I open them again.– Considering however the short stay I made at Hastings it was impossible to procure them on any other terms so that if they all spoil before I get home to open them, – we must suppose I never got them at all. – also a small packet of lichens from the rocks by the sea coast – also 3 or 4 new Diadelphia plants which I cannot name , one of which puzzles me exceedingly. – I trust however that my best Botanizing is yet to come – I arrived here on Saturday evening– yesterday (Sunday) did nothing. – This morning I went out at 10 intending to go to Frant across Waterdown forest, but had not got a mile before the rain turned me back, so that this will be a blank day, with the exception of what I got in this mile, which I don’t dispise – viz: Galium saxatile, -Senecio sylvaticus, a nice moss decidedly new to me, & a beautiful little waterplant growing in boggy places by the side of the road, which I don’t know at all unless it is Peplis portula.--- On the whole my tour has turned out ten times better than my best expectations, & I have been very much pleased with all I have seen: To say the truth, before I started I was rather uncertain about the result as I have never tried anything of the sort before, & was going all alone;- but everything has turned out so well – the weather has been so fine - & my health & spirits so good that I never enjoyed myself more in my life.– If I have been diss disappointed in anything I think it is in my not having found more maritime plants at Hastings: tho spent one of the most laborious days in clambering over the cliffs & rocks for some distance both above & below the town, I could find no traces of the Eryngium, or anything else of consequence except this thing which I suppose to be Beta marit. & also a plant (which by the by I forgot to mention before) that I cannot help fancying to be Crithmum marit.– None of it however was in flower though in pale bud.– It grew on the steepest declivities hanging over the sea, & very little of it was accessible; I bought away a couple of specimens.– The last letter I wrote to Ely was from Hastings, & I shall not write again there perhaps for some days; so that by next communication send them word that you have heard of me at Tunbridge Wells.– Oh what [a] nice place this is, – so beautiful at this time of year, that I forget that I [page torn] & cannot hold my tongue – I certainly am rather in want of somebody [page torn] out to every minute.– I came by your orders to the Sussex Hotel, where [every] thing is very nice certainly, but things are so magnificent, that I shall be [page torn} [frighten]ened out of my wits when I ask for my bill.– the coffee room is quite [page torn] – I am not however much in it. – The place seems full, & the people [page torn] very gay.– a band of music plays 4 times a day just opposite [page torn] for an hour at a time which is delightful.– The theatre is open and I have some thoughts of going to it tonight, as I shall have no plants today, & not much else to do.– But the roads are so abominably sandy & dusty that they are scarcely walkable: they beat everything I ever saw in my life, really every step one takes raises such a cloud, that it is like walking in a box of pounce.–I shall stay here till Friday, on which day I intend to be off for Rochester, & have written them word to say so, under the idea that you have already said something about it before, as you promised.– whilst there I should be glad to hear from one of you as I have not had a line from a soul since I left home.–When my departure for Cambridge is finally fixed, you will hear from me again as I shall dine with you on that day, & sleep in your spare bed if empty, if not at the Sun: on which occasion all further particulars relating to my extensive travels shall be full revealed to you both.– Believe me, your’s very affectionly  L.

The period of the year when found I could not learn but it was brought to me in Jan. y the middle of the summer there, & must have been recently found when I received it– I still consider that I have to send you Specimens of any interesting Minerals I may have, but as you may suppose I have had no time of late to look them over– I remain |my Dear Sir |yours very faithfully |Geo: Grant", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[170, 180, "ORG"], [254, 269, "ORG"], [277, 285, "GPE"], [500, 503, "CARDINAL"], [544, 552, "PRODUCT"], [684, 690, "PERSON"], [724, 739, "ORG"], [953, 965, "DATE"], [1200, 1209, "ORG"], [1460, 1468, "ORG"], [1675, 1681, "ORG"], [1773, 1786, "ORG"], [1887, 1907, "LOC"], [1963, 1988, "ORG"], [1990, 2012, "DATE"], [2077, 2101, "DATE"], [2202, 2211, "PERSON"], [2366, 2370, "CARDINAL"]]}
{"id": 3019, "text": "It was unlucky and ill-advised of me not to tell you of my sudden departure from Ipswich, but as I hoped to meet you on the 19 th in London & my letter was on the 17 th, I did not imagine you would write to Ipswich. I ought to have imagined. We decided at the Council exactly nothing. So strong a feeling however prevailed for going to Ipswich in 1850, that I felt it right to say to my Ipswich friends, they ought to persevere in this request for that year. What will come of it is to be seen. The invitations from Edinburgh were more serious than we thought, but is very doubtful if they will be prosecuted. In this case Ipswich wins for 1850, but not for 1851. Then Belfast & Edinb. must divide the votes. Some other arrangement may indeed be proposed but I think my Ipswich friends will have the best chance by now of urging for 1850. We shall ask you to be Pres. of II at Birmingham.
